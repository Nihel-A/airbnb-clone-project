## Database Design

The database design is critical for the efficient storage and retrieval of all project data. We will use **PostgreSQL** as our relational database management system. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

### Key Entities

* **Users**
    * `user_id` (Primary Key)
    * `username` (Unique)
    * `email` (Unique)
    * `password_hash`
    * `registration_date`

* **Properties**
    * `property_id` (Primary Key)
    * `host_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
    * `title`
    * `description`
    * `price_per_night`
    * `location`
    * `availability_status`

* **Bookings**
    * `booking_id` (Primary Key)
    * `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
    * `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
    * `check_in_date`
    * `check_out_date`
    * `total_price`
    * `booking_status` (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled)

* **Reviews**
    * `review_id` (Primary Key)
    * `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
    * `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
    * `rating` (1-5 stars)
    * `comment`
    * `review_date`

* **Payments**
    * `payment_id` (Primary Key)
    * `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
    * `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
    * `amount`
    * `payment_date`
    * `payment_status` (e.g., successful, failed, pending)
    * `transaction_id` (from payment gateway)

### Entity Relationships

* **Users and Properties:** A `User` can be a host and therefore can list **multiple** `Properties`. Each `Property` belongs to **one** `User` (host).
* **Users and Bookings:** A `User` can make **multiple** `Bookings`. Each `Booking` is made by **one** `User`.
* **Properties and Bookings:** A `Property` can have **multiple** `Bookings`. Each `Booking` is for **one** `Property`.
* **Users and Reviews:** A `User` can write **multiple** `Reviews`. Each `Review` is written by **one** `User`.
* **Properties and Reviews:** A `Property` can receive **multiple** `Reviews`. Each `Review` is for **one** `Property`.
* **Bookings and Payments:** Each `Booking` can have **one** `Payment` associated with it (or multiple if partial payments are allowed, but for simplicity, we'll assume one primary payment). Each `Payment` is tied to **one** `Booking`.
* **Users and Payments:** A `User` can initiate **multiple** `Payments` for various bookings. Each `Payment` is initiated by **one** `User`.

## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone backend is designed to support a comprehensive set of features to replicate the core functionality of a real-world booking platform.

* **User Management:** This feature handles all aspects of user accounts, from registration and secure login to profile updates. It ensures that users can securely access and manage their personal information and interact with the platform.
* **Property Management:** This allows hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings, including details like descriptions, pricing, and availability. It is crucial for providing the content that users can browse and book.
* **Booking System:** This core feature enables users to search for, select, and reserve properties for specific dates. It manages the entire booking lifecycle, including availability checks, reservation confirmations, and booking status updates.
* **Payment Processing:** This feature integrates with a payment gateway to securely handle financial transactions for bookings. It ensures that payments are processed accurately, recorded, and reconciled, which is vital for the financial operations of the platform.
* **Review System:** This allows users to leave feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed in. It contributes to building trust and transparency within the community, helping other users make informed decisions about bookings.

## API Security

API security is paramount for protecting sensitive user data, financial transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the platform. We will implement robust security measures to safeguard our backend.

* **Authentication:** This verifies the identity of users and systems attempting to access the API. It is crucial for protecting user data, ensuring that only legitimate users can access their profiles and initiate actions like booking or payment.
* **Authorization:** This determines what authenticated users are permitted to do within the API. It ensures that users can only perform actions relevant to their role (e.g., a guest cannot modify a host's property listing), preventing unauthorized access and manipulation of data.
* **Rate Limiting:** This controls the number of API requests a client can make within a specific timeframe. It is vital for preventing abuse, such as brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attempts, which could compromise the availability and performance of our services.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline is an automated process that enables developers to integrate code changes frequently and reliably, and then deliver those changes to production environments.

CI/CD pipelines are important for this project because they will:
* **Accelerate Development:** By automating testing and deployment, we can release new features and bug fixes much faster.
* **Improve Code Quality:** Automated tests run with every code change, catching bugs early and ensuring a higher quality codebase.
* **Reduce Manual Errors:** Automation minimizes human error during the deployment process, leading to more stable releases.
* **Foster Collaboration:** Developers can integrate their work more frequently, reducing integration conflicts and improving team efficiency.

Tools that could be used for our CI/CD pipeline include **GitHub Actions** for orchestrating the workflow (triggering builds, tests, and deployments) and **Docker** for creating consistent and portable application environments across different stages of the pipeline.
