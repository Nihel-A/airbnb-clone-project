# Airbnb Clone Backend

---

## Overview

Welcome to the **Airbnb Clone Backend** project! This project aims to build a robust and scalable backend system that mimics the core functionalities of Airbnb. Our goal is to provide a solid foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments, ensuring a seamless experience for both users and hosts. This project serves as a comprehensive, real-world application to deepen your understanding of full-stack development, backend architecture, database design, API development, and application security.

## Project Goals

Our primary goals for this project include:

* **User Management:** Implementing a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
* **Property Management:** Developing features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
* **Booking System:** Creating a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
* **Payment Processing:** Integrating a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
* **Review System:** Allowing users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* **Data Optimization:** Ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack

The backend for the Airbnb Clone is built using a modern and powerful technology stack to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability:

* **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API and handling core business logic.
* **Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive toolkit for creating and managing RESTful APIs with ease.
* **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database used for robust and scalable data storage.
* **GraphQL:** Offers a flexible and efficient query language for interacting with the backend, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.
* **Celery:** An asynchronous task queue used for handling long-running or resource-intensive tasks, such as sending notifications or processing payments, without blocking the main application thread.
* **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store used for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times, as well as for session management.
* **Docker:** A containerization platform used to create consistent and isolated development and deployment environments, ensuring the application runs the same way everywhere.
* **CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions):** Automated pipelines for continuous integration and continuous deployment, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment of code changes, leading to faster and more reliable releases.
